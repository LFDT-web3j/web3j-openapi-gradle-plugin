web3j OpenAPI Gradle Plugin
===================

Left things:
- SwaggerUI generation
- cleaning build when generating OpenAPI or at least delete the OpenAPI directory
- The version in the gradle.properties affect the test via making it believe we are trying to use this plugin version as the `web3j-core`, ie `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`.
